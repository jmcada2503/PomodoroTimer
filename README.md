# PomodoroTimer
This project is a timer that can help you to use the pomodoro technique with a little updates created by myself. When the work time finish (25min) the timer starts counting the extra work time youre using until you tell the page that it's break time, the extra time that you worked is added to your break time, keeping the relation 25:5 or 5:1.

# Instructions
Clone the repository, run the PomodoroTimer.html file and start the timer.

# Keybindings
- SpaceBar (Start or stop the timer)  
- Enter (Reset the timer when it is paused or finish your extra work time)
